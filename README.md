### Predictive Modeling and Model Comparison
This project involves building and evaluating two predictive models to predict the target variable of a dataset. 
A comprehensive comparison of the models' performance is conducted using standard metrics for classification and regression problems.

### Features

**1. Predictive Models:**

Model 1: Neural Network 
Model 2: Hybrid (Neural Network- kNearest Neighbour)

**2. Performance Metrics:**

Classification Tasks: Accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**3. Evaluation:**

A detailed comparison of the models' performance based on the above metrics.
